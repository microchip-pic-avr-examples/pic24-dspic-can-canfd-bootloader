  </ol>
  <img src="readme_files/hardware.jpg"><br><br>

  <h3>Programming the Bootloader</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Open the boot.x project in MPLAB® X</li>
    <li>Press the “Make and Program” button on the top bar.</li>
    <img src="readme_files/program.png"><br><br>
    <li>Select the appropriate programmer if prompted.</li>
    <li>The project should compile and program successfully.</li>
    <li>Verify the D3 LED is solid on the Explorer 16/32. This indicates the bootloader is running.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Building the Application</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Open the app.X project in MPLAB® X
    <li>Press the “Clean and Build Project” button on the top bar.
      <b>NOTE</b>: Make sure not to hit the program button. This will program the application code over the bootloader
      that was
      just programmed.
      <img src="readme_files/compile.png"><br><br>

    <li>The project should compile cleanly. app.X/dist/default/production/app.X.production.hex should be generated.
    <li>Verify that the D3 LED is still solid.
      <ol type="a">
        <li>If the D3 LED is blinking instead of D3 solid, then the application code was programmed instead of only
          compiled.
          Go back to the “Programming the Bootloader” stage and re-program the bootloader.
        </li>
      </ol>
  </ol>

  <h3>Loading the Application</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Open the Universal Bootloader Host Application tool (UBHA)</li>
    <img src="readme_files/ubha.jpg"><br><br>
    <li>Select the “PIC24/dsPIC” option from the “Device Architecture” selection drop down</li>
    <img src="readme_files/pic24f.png"><br><br>
    <li>Select “CAN” from the protocol drop down selection box:</li>
    <img src="readme_files/can.png"><br><br>
    <li>Select the “Settings->CAN” option from the top menu</li>
    <img src="readme_files/settings.png"><br><br>
    <li>Select the Peak protocol analyzer being used and the appropriate CAN configuration settings and press “Apply”
      when
      done. By default, the configuration for the demo are the following:</li>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Nominal bit rate: 125 kbits/sec</li>
      <li>Host to device ID: 0xA1</li>
      <li>Device to host ID: 0xA2</li>
    </ol>
    <img src="readme_files/settings_can.jpg"><br><br>
    <li>Press the “Read Device Settings” button.</li>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>The Application start address and Application end address fields should have updated. If it did not or if you
        get a
        communication error, please go back to the “Programming the Bootloader” stage to make sure the bootloader was
        programmed correctly.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <img src="readme_files/read_device.png"><br><br>
    <li>Load the application hex file by selecting “File->Open/Load File (*.hex)”</li>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Select the file generated in the previous section: app.X/dist/default/production/app.X.production.hex
      </li>
    </ol>
    <img src="readme_files/open.png"><br><br>
    <li>Press “Program Device”. The application should program erase, program and readback verify correctly.</li>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>After a few seconds, D3 should be blinking.</li>
    </ol>
  </ol>

  <h2>Customizing the Bootloader Project</h2>
  The bootloader project can be opened in MCC and new modules can be added and configured as they normally would in MCC.
  Additionally, the parameters in the Bootloader:Bootloader module can be re-configured.

  <h3>Changing the CAN bitrate</h3>
  The CAN bitrate of the bootloader can be easily changed. By default the bitrate is set to 125 kbits/second. To change
  the bitrate, do the following:
  <ol>
    <li>Open the bootloader project.</li>
    <li>Open the MCC plug-in by clicking on the MCC icon in the tool bar of MPLAB X.</li>
    <img src="readme_files/mcc.png"><br><br>
    <li>Select the CAN1 module from the project resources pane on the left navigation pane. This will open the CAN1
      module settings in the main configuration window.</li>
    <img src="readme_files/can1.png"><br><br>
    <li>Expand the "Bit Rate Settings" pane and make the desired bit rate changes.</li>
    <img src="readme_files/bitrate.png"><br><br>
    <li>Re-generate the project by pressing the generate button in the project resources pane.</li>
    <img src="readme_files/generate.png"><br><br>
    <li>Re-build/program the bootloader into the board.</li>
    <img src="readme_files/program.png"><br><br>
    <li>Re-open the settings window in the UBHA program.</li>
    <img src="readme_files/settings.png"><br><br>
    <li>Change the nominal bit rate to match what was selected in MCC. <b>NOTE:</b> The Peak analyzer/generator is
      limited to what bit rates it can generate so not all bit rates possible by the micro-controller can be realized by
      this hardware generator. You are limited to the bit rates listed in the UBHA selection window.</li>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>When the bit rate has been changed, press apply.</li>
    </ol>
    <img src="readme_files/settings_can.jpg"><br><br>
    <li>You can now press the program button or read device settings button as before and the device should now be
      communicating using the new bit rate selected.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Changing the Host to Device ID</h3>
  This is changing the message ID of the messages sent from the PC bootloader host to the target board.  Currently the same message ID must be used for both ISO 15765-2 message and flow control frames. To change the message ID used from host to device, do the following:
  <ol>
    <li>Open the bootloader project.</li>
    <li>Open the MCC plug-in by clicking on the MCC icon in the tool bar of MPLAB X.</li>
    <img src="readme_files/mcc.png"><br><br>
    <li>Select the CAN1 module from the project resources pane on the left navigation pane. This will open the CAN1
      module settings in the main configuration window.</li>
    <img src="readme_files/can1.png"><br><br>
    <li>Expand the "Transmit-Receive Settings" pane.</li>
    <img src="readme_files/filter.png"><br><br>
    <li>Add a new Message ID with the desired value.  In this example we entered the value 0xA5 and then pressed the Add Button with the Blue "+". This adds the 0xa5 row to the "Message Acceptance Filter" table below.</li>
    <img src="readme_files/filter_a5_create.png"><br><br>
    <li>After the filter 0xa5 was added, we need to delete the old value of 0xa1 value, by clicking on the row containing 0xa1, and pressing the Remove button.</li>
    <img src="readme_files/filter_a5.png"><br><br>
    <li>Re-generate the project by pressing the generate button in the project resources pane.</li>
    <img src="readme_files/generate.png"><br><br>
    <li>Re-build/program the bootloader into the board.</li>
    <img src="readme_files/program.png"><br><br>
    <li>Re-open the settings window in the UBHA program.</li>
    <img src="readme_files/settings.png"><br><br>
    <li>Change the "Host to Device ID" field to match the value used in the MCC filter object settings, in this example 0xA5.</li>
    <img src="readme_files/host_to_device_a5.png"><br><br>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>When the message ID has been changed, press apply.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>You can now press the program button or read device settings button as before and the device should now be
      communicating using the new message IDs from the host to the device.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Changing the Device To Host ID</h3>
  This is changing the message ID of the messages sent from the target board back to the PC host.  Currently the same message ID must be used for both ISO 15765-2 message and flow control frames. To change the message ID used from device to host, do the following:
  <ol>
    <li>Open the bootloader project.</li>
    <li>Open the can_tp_config.h file in the "Headers/MCC Generated Files" section of the MPLAB X project.</li>
    <img src="readme_files/config_header.png"><br><br>
    <li>Change the values for the CAN_TP_MESSAGE_ID_DATA and CAN_TP_MESSAGE_ID_FLOW_CONTROL to the desired value.  In this example it is changed from 0xA2 to 0xA4.<br><b>NOTE:</b> Due to a constraint in the UBHA hos program, the same message ID must be used for both the data and flow control messages.  Please make these two values the same.</li>
    <img src="readme_files/config_header_a4.png"><br><br>
    <li>Re-build/program the bootloader into the board.</li>
    <img src="readme_files/program.png"><br><br>
    <li>Re-open the settings window in the UBHA program.</li>
    <img src="readme_files/settings.png"><br><br>
    <li>Change the "Device To Host ID" field to match the value used in can_tp_config.h file, in this example 0xA4.</li>
    <img src="readme_files/device_to_host_a4.png"><br><br>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>When the message ID has been changed, press apply.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>You can now press the program button or read device settings button as before and the device should now be
      communicating using the new message IDs from the device to the host.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Customizing the Application Project</h2>
  The application MCC configuration can be opened and modules can be added or modified as desired.

<h2>Known Limitations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Only CAN classic is supported.  For CAN-FD support, use the CAN-FD demo as a starting point instead.</li>
</ul>

  <h2>Terminology</h2>
  <b>ISO 15765-2 / CAN-TP / ISO-TP</b>
  <p>
    ISO 15765-2 is a transport protocol layer designed for usage with the CAN bus. The original CAN bus specification
    allows for up to 8 bytes of data to be in a single frame. Larger messages need to be fragmented into smaller frames
    for transmission on the CAN bus. ISO 15765-2 defines a protocol for fragmenting larger messages and sending them
    over the CAN bus. It also incorporates flexibility in handling the data transmission through the use of flow control
    packets to control the frequency of when packets arrive as well allowing to pause the transmission of a message
    until the receiver is ready to receive the message.</p>
